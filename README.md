# revid
Reversi game for Mr. Waller's Computer Science class in 2021 during my exchange year in the United States of America 

## What's the game?
The game idea is not from me and copied, but only the game idea. I did not copy any code.\
Here you can find my inspiration and the game rules: https://github.com/TheRealMephisto/core \
The goal of the game is to have more fields than your opponent at the end of the game.\
Initially, my intention was to create an AI for the game, but I ran out of time and therefore you can choose an AI as your opponent, but it will only make random turns.\
The UI is mostly responsible, just the text is not. So, if the window gets to small there will be displaying errors with text elements.

## Requirements
The project was tested with Python 3.9\
Additionally, you need to install the following libraries:
- pygame

That's it, only pygame
